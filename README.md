# pyDrude
 Repository for the Master-Thesis project: *"Modern approach to the Drude weight: metallic and insulating systems within Open Boundary Conditions"*
 
---------------------------
 
This records the state of the code at the end of the thesis project (i.e. at the date of graduation). Some minor polishing may be ahead, but further development is not planned as the project already migrated to a new repository (and the code has been ported, extended and debugged in matlab). Please notice that almost surely the code hides some critical bug, as it contains old and unmantained source files. I advice to not use it and instead refer to the newer matlab version.
